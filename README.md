# MathProblem

Created this project to help a friend of mine on a school project.

The first goal was to create a triangle that divides itself in smaller triangles.
Completed this part, run the program and click the button "Hello", it will generate a triangle already sliced, but you can keep pressing the button and it will keep slicing the triangle
Fun fact: Slicing the triangle, generate a new pattern everytime


The second goal was close to the first one, but instead of a triangle it was a quadrilateral.
This part was not completed but it can be tested pressing the "HelloQ" button
